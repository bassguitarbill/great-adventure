# Great Adventure
I want to make a game based on (https://hiddenmachines.bandcamp.com/album/a-great-adventure-awaits)[A GREAT ADVENTURE AWAITS], because it's a great album. The game will be a shoot-em-up / dodge-em-up, as this is the only genre I could conceive that would allow the song to be played in its entirety, with game action synced to the song (other than a rhythm game, which, eh).

### Installation
The game should run out of the box, with (assets/music/README.md)[one small exception].
